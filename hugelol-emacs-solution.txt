initial plan: 
	hugelol/hiddenlol scraper -> file -> live update emacs -> show embedded post

ended up:
      scraper is easy, hugelol has simple API for getting the good stuff
      hidden doesn't have that - manual fetching will be needed #TODO
      no idea about hugereaction, etc. #TODO
      could be useful to make it fetch from similar webservices #TODO
      emacs doesn't seem to have out-of-the-box proper html+js support, w3m js-minimal could be start #TODO
      add limit to scraper #TODO
      ideal case scenario - download each X seconds -> buffer to some bash thing -> render to emacs
            	 	    ^implemented    	       ^no idea                     ^ (╥_╥)
