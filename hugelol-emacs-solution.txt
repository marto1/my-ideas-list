initial plan:
	hugelol/hiddenlol scraper -> file -> live update emacs -> show embedded post

ended up:
      scraper is easy, hugelol has simple API for getting the good stuff
      hidden doesn't have that - manual fetching will be needed #TODO
      no idea about hugereaction, etc. #TODO
      could be useful to make it fetch from similar webservices #TODO
      w3m was not good enough.
      add limit to scraper #TODO
      ideal case scenario - download each X seconds -> buffer to some bash thing -> render to emacs
			    ^implemented	       ^no idea                     ^ (╥_╥) implemented
										    but very buggy still
										    #TODO doesn't support multiple windows
										    #TODO is not a mode still
