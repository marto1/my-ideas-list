utf-8 in xscreensaver/phosphor should work in latest version, from phosphor.c:
            case '%': /* Select charset */
              /* @: Select default (ISO 646 / ISO 8859-1)
                 G: Select UTF-8
                 8: Select UTF-8 (obsolete)

                 We can just ignore this and always process UTF-8, I think?
                 We must still catch the last byte, though.
