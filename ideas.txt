############################# NEAR FUTURE #############################
dependency trees of technologies. What was built on top of what.
cloning of running systems with hash caching(is that implemented in rsync kinda already?)
command "templates" - set command template with placeholders (tab -> insert -> tab -> insert -> enter -> get output -> reset)
capture drawing library calls from browsers.(ltrace!?)
rule-based testing. Example: set variable lock variable to be only one type; or never cross range 100-240 while running program(or tests)
simpler GNOME Do.
many-to-one zero overhead compositor. (many events -> compositor -> stdout)
git cannot download(just download) a single file or directory, bad
bidirectional IPC communication with browser through keyboard events. (I know)
ewmh remove decorations utility MWM_HINTS_DECORATIONS (1L << 1) 
(like https://github.com/gusnan/devilspie2/blob/f12744d0735e4dde5679734ab57bc77ee8ab1ec6/src/xutils.c#L194)
mozilla readability - dump to stdout utility
google it for you - open a site, focus, mark a section of text, effects - all in a url

############################# WILD ############################# 
how to prove something computes?
workflow profiler - extract patterns in working with computers.
debug msp430 usb controller
js deobfuscator that actually does something - at least constant replacement (tools for debugging, really, they all suck currently)
data tresure hunt generator - with clues for next one 
As the question Why? is fundamental to science there should be a quick way(in Firefox for example) to ask it when a statement is made.
For example: Go to Water wiki page -> "Water is widely used in chemical reactions as a solvent" -> "ask" why -> get statistics and verification in an orthogonal way.
Tree-based browsing. Tabbing is not efficient enough and does not really follow how my brain works - tree-based browsing.
build kindle-like reader
diagram generation language that is not painfull to use.
byte code as interface to relational databases 
get the code for the "stack overflow autocompletion", combine it with dash repos and make a standalone tool for browsing docs.
